# Dynamical-Modeling-of-Hexabot-Leg-



This initiative concentrates on constructing dynamic models for a variety of robotic mechanisms, including the Hexabot Robot.  The project explores the motion and forces of these robotic entities using MATLAB and Simulink, incorporating the application of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters and robot kinematics. For the Hexabot Robot, the project includes an in-depth examination of the robot's structural framework and the computation of its Jacobian.

Additionally, the project encompasses a thorough analysis and report on the dynamic behavior of a double pendulum system,  
with Prof. CÃ©dric Anthierens  and Prof. Vincent Hugel at the University of Toulon providing expert guidance.
